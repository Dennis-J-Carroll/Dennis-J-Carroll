I'm pursuing a Master's in Data Science with a focus on machine learning and analytics. I believe we're standing at the edge of something immeasurable and not just because of what AI can do, but because of what we'll accomplish when we wield it as a tool for curiosity and discovery. My work is driven by that vision: building systems that don't just solve problems, but open doors to questions we haven't even thought to ask yet.


### Current Endeavors
- **Master's Studies**: Specializing in advanced data modeling, machine learning, and data analytics.
- **Self-Learning**: Working on development projects that focus on metrics implementation and feature engineering to optimize performance.
- **Development Focus**: Exploring development structure, measuring and improving various metrics, and engineering features to enrich data-driven models.

## Skills & Learning Interests
- **Machine Learning**: Model optimization, predictive analytics, and algorithm design.
- **Data Science**: Feature engineering, statistical modeling, and insightful data visualizations.
- **Software Development**: Developing scalable, maintainable codebases with a focus on data-driven architecture.
- **Astronomy & Mathematics**: Combining a love for the stars and complex mathematical theories to analyze and understand the universe. I think there is a lot to be discovered when you combined physics with computer science. 

## Collaboration Interests
I'm always looking to collaborate on a variety projects:
- **Deep Learning**: I am exploring the frontier where math meets intuition through Neural Networks. I intend to focus my contributions on Deep Learning and NLP, striving to make model interaction indistinguishable from human conversation.
- **Game Development**: Building immersive and engaging gaming experiences.
- **Sports Statistics**: Analyzing and creating tools for sports data and metrics.
- **Algorithm Development**: Experimenting with new algorithms and methodologies to solve real-world problems.
